## Introduction
What is the musical taste of the different generations living in Switzerland? To answer this question, the Tamedia Datajournalism Team looked at data from Spotify and built the (Musical-Taste Analysis Tool available here)[https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/].  

As a reminder we define the generations as follows:  
*Generation Z: born 1994 or later  
*Generation Y: born 1981-1994  
*Generation X: born 1965-1980  
*Generation Babyboomer: born 1946-1964  

We asked Spotify to give us the 100 most often played songs from these generations. These lists are shared here in the "Data_Input" folder. The musical features of these songs were then analysed visualized.

The user can then compare his own musical taste with the averge of the Top100 of the different generations.


## Spotify API / Spotipy

Einige Beispielelemente:

**Spotify API:**
We use the spotify API for two things:
- Getting musical features of songs
- Getting the Top100 tracks of users

The authorization process is bit tricky. First you need a Spotify account. Then you need to upgrade this account to a developer account and you need to create a "Spotify App" in this account. From this App you need the Client-ID and the Client-Secret-ID. For help with this check the documentation on (spotify.com)[https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/] and (Spotipy)[https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#authorized-requests]  

For General Documentation refer to the (Spotify API-Documentation)[https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/]

**Spotipy**
To facilitate working with the Spotify API, the package "Spotipy" was used. Documentation can be found here: https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/
